# Cleantech GrowthLab Integration

This directory contains all the integration code and documentation for Cleantech GrowthLab's methodologies and growth optimization strategies.

## Key Components

### 1. Documentation

- [growthlab_integration.md](docs/growthlab_integration.md): Comprehensive guide to integrating with GrowthLab's methodologies
- API documentation: Specialized endpoints for growth optimization
- Configuration guides: Environment variables and setup instructions

### 2. Configuration

- [config.py](config.py): GrowthLab integration configuration
- Environment variables: GrowthLab-specific settings
- Metrics thresholds: Optimization parameters

### 3. Integration Points

1. **Growth Playbook Integration**
   - Zero-Waste Growth Framework
   - ROI-focused lead scoring
   - Customizable growth playbooks

2. **Data Integration**
   - Lead scoring model
   - Growth metrics tracking
   - CAC optimization
   - ROI calculation

3. **API Integration**
   - Specialized endpoints
   - Growth optimization metrics
   - Playbook management

## Setup

1. Create environment variables:
```env
GROWTHLAB_API_KEY=your-key
GROWTHLAB_PLAYBOOK_ID=your-id
GROWTHLAB_STRATEGY=zero-waste
```

2. Configure metrics thresholds:
```env
PIPELINE_VELOCITY_THRESHOLD=0.8
CONVERSION_RATE_THRESHOLD=0.2
CAC_OPTIMIZATION_THRESHOLD=1.5
```

## Usage

1. Initialize GrowthLab configuration:
```python
from growthlab.config import GrowthLabConfig

config = GrowthLabConfig()
metrics = config.get_growth_metrics()
```

2. Generate growth reports:
```python
report = config.generate_growth_report()
recommendations = config.get_growth_recommendations()
```

## Best Practices

1. Regular metric updates
2. Growth strategy alignment
3. Performance monitoring
4. Continuous optimization
